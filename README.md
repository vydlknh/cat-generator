This web app: **generates a random image of a cat and its attributes using The Cat API**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [ ] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [ ] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I have never implemented API, so this project was quite challenging. It is also during midterm week, so I did not have enough time to do all the required features on time.
